                    Hello there, I am Damian, a guy from Silistra, Bulgaria, 19 years of age. What I like to do is creating different stuff. Stuff like websites, games, apps, etc. Therefore, my passion lies in programming, problem solving and bringing fresh ideas to life. Even before I got my hands on actual programming, I loved to create web pages using Photoshop, HTML and CSS. At some point of my life, I really liked modeling 3D characters, cars, planes, houses and other stuff. But what I really love doing is programming. Transforming a blank randomFile.cs into a correctly working application with only using a keyboard, a mouse and a brain feels amazing. The harder the task is â€“ the better. My language pool includes C#, JS, HTML, CSS and others. You can view all of the technologies that I have experience with here, and the projects that I have created or worked on in my portfolio.
